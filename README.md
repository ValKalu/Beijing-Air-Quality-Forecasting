# Beijing-Air-Quality-Forecasting

Beijing Air Quality Forecasting Project Overview
This project is a graded assignment for the Machine Learning Techniques I course, focusing on the critical task of forecasting PM2.5 (fine particulate matter) air pollution levels in Beijing. We utilize the power of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, which are particularly well-suited for time-series data analysis.

Accurate prediction of PM2.5 concentrations is paramount for effective environmental policy-making, safeguarding public health, and enabling timely interventions such as issuing health advisories or implementing traffic regulations.

Objectives
The core objectives pursued in this project include:

Data Preparation: Robustly preprocess sequential air quality and meteorological datasets to identify patterns and ensure readiness for advanced modeling.

Model Development: Design and train sophisticated RNN/LSTM models specifically tailored for the complexities of time-series forecasting.

Performance Optimization: Systematically fine-tune model architectures and hyperparameters to achieve optimal predictive performance, aiming for a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) below 4000 on the Kaggle Leaderboard.

Evaluation: Rigorously evaluate model accuracy using standard metrics, primarily RMSE.

Prediction Generation: Produce final, well-formatted predictions of PM2.5 levels for the provided test dataset.
